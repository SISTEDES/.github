# Sociedad de Ingeniería de Software y Tecnologías de Desarrollo de Software (Sistedes)

Sistedes is a non-profit association created in 2005 with the main objective of contributing to the scientific and technological development of Spain in the area of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies, as well as promoting research, innovation and technology transfer between the different agents involved in the advancement of these disciplines.

To fulfill the purposes of the Association, Sistedes is in charge of organizing an annual scientific conference (the Sistedes Conference: JISBD, PROLE, JCIS), and of offering a set of activities and services to its members and to the entire Spanish community working in the areas of Software Engineering and Software Development Technologies.

This GitHub organization hosts different tools that support us on the organization of the events Sistedes organizes.
